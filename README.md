# SAIT Object Oriented Software Development Program (SAIT OOSD) README.md

Hello Sam,

Welcome to my SAIT Object Oriented Software Development (OOSD) program website! My name is **Carlos Hernandez-Zelaya**, and Iâ€™m excited to share this repository with you. It contains all the necessary files to support the program's web application, showcasing various aspects of object-oriented software development.

This project is designed as a website for **Travel Experts: Rocky Mountain Vacations**, a travel agency that focuses on providing exceptional experiences in the stunning Rocky Mountains. I hope this project reflects my understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and my ability to create a user-friendly website that meets the needs of Travel Experts.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into four main folders:

- **html**: Contains the core HTML files for the website, including:
  - `index.html`: The main landing page.
  - `contact.html`: A page for users to get in touch.
  - `register.html`: A registration page for new users.
  - `redirect.html`: A page that handles URL redirection.

- **css**: This folder holds the `style.css` stylesheet, which defines the visual styling for the website.

- **js**: Contains JavaScript files that add interactivity to the website:
  - `index.js`: Scripts for the main page functionality.
  - `register.js`: Scripts specific to the registration process.

- **images**: This folder is dedicated to storing all image assets used throughout the website.

## Special Notes

In the `redirect.html` file, there are comments that provide guidance on how to navigate around pop-up blockers. Specifically, if the redirect does not work as intended, please comment out line 33, disable pop-up blockers, and then uncomment line 33 (which contains the `window.close()` command) to ensure proper functionality.

Thank you for taking the time to review my work on the SAIT OOSD program website for **Travel Experts: Rocky Mountain Vacations**! If you have any questions or need further clarification, please feel free to reach out. I look forward to your feedback!
